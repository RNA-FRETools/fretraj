FRETraj - Predicting FRET *in silico* 
=====================================

FRETraj is a high-level Python API to the **LabelLib** library (https://github.com/Fluorescence-Tools/LabelLib) to simulate fluorophores which are coupled to a biomolecule of interest. The package features a user-friendly **PyMOL plugin** [#]_ which can be used to explore different labeling positions while designing new FRET experiments. In an AV simulation the fluorophore distribution is estimated by a shortest path search (Djikstra algorithm) using a coarse-grained dye probe. FRETraj further implements a **Python-only** version of the geometrical clash search used in LabelLib. This should facilitate prototyping of new features for the ACV algorithm.

Plugin Installation
*******************

You can get the latest version of PyMOL from `Schr√∂dinger <https://pymol.org/>`_. Start the **Anaconda prompt** which comes bundled with PyMOL 2.x and install the necessary dependencies. ::

    conda install numpy "numba<=0.44" mdtraj packaging -c conda-forge

For a faster calculation of the AVs you may additionally install `LabelLib <https://github.com/Fluorescence-Tools/LabelLib>`_, but this is not required as FRETraj also runs its own implementation of the AV algorithm. ::

    conda install -c tpeulen labellib

To use the FRETraj PyMOL plugin simply download the .zip archive from Github and install it via PyMOL's Plugin manager: ``Plugin`` :raw-html:`&rarr;` ``Plugin manager`` :raw-html:`&rarr;` ``Install New Plugin`` :raw-html:`&rarr;` ``Choose file...`` and select the .zip archive. Upon first startup FRETraj will prompt you to select a root directory where to store the calculated ACVs and parameter files. You can load a **demo project** by going to ``Help`` :raw-html:`&rarr;` ``Load Example``. You may also want to have a look at this :doc:`step-by-step tutorial <pymol_plugin>`.
